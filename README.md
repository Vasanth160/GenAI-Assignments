# GenAI-Assignments

This repository stores daily assignments and projects completed as part of the GenAI course.  
Each assignment is kept in its own folder with versioned commits and a short README describing objective, approach, and files.

## How this repo is organized
- `assignments/` — assignment folders named by date and short title (e.g. `2025-11-30-credit-card-testdata`)
- `artifacts/` — generated files (Excel, JSON, images, models)
- `scripts/` — helper scripts for validation, formatting, or automation
- `docs/` — notes, design decisions, and test plans

## Contributing / workflow
1. Create a feature branch: `feat/<yyyy-mm-dd>-<short-title>` (example: `feat/2025-11-30-credit-card-data`)
2. Add files in `assignments/<folder>` and `artifacts/` as needed.
3. Commit with message format: `<type>(<scope>): <short description>` (see template below)
4. Open a Pull Request (PR) to `main` and include a short description of the assignment.
5. Merge after self-review or feedback.
